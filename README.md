# Lucca Faces Solver

A simple solver for the Lucca Faces game, utilizing only `requests`. This project was created as part of a web development journey and for fun! While functional, it could be further optimized to achieve the highest possible score.

## Features
- Automates gameplay using HTTP requests.
- Can be improved for better efficiency.
- 15 iterations of the game are ideal for maximizing the score.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lucca-faces-solver.git
   cd Lucca-faces-solver
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the solver script:
```bash

```

## Optimization
- The current solver works efficiently but could be optimized further.
- Improvements could include better decision-making strategies and minimizing the number of requests.
